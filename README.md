# triplels_photo_editor

This is a Flutter app that I wrote for my godmom actually, to add her brand logo and some texts on her product photos before uploading to social media.

The reason I decide to create an app for her is because other image editing apps are too overwhelming and complicated to her. Another reason is an excuse for me to learn Flutter :P.

This is a work in progress.
